##Table of Contents

##Project Description
    - this project is all about performing EDA on a data table extracted from a dataframe stored in AWS RDS. Cleaning the data (including reformatting columns, removing outlier, dealing with missing values and more), analysing the data and visualising it using various techniques. 
    - There were many learnings from doing this project. Importantly it made use of all of the modules completed before embarking on it. It was also great to see how, using code, the tabular data could be transformed into easily digestible charts
