##Project Description
    - This project is all about performing experimental data analysis on a data table extracted from a database stored in AWS RDS. 
    - There were many learnings from doing this project. It required me to put into practise a wide range of knowledge and skills picked up so far on the AiCore Data Science course. It was also great to see how, using code, tabular data can be manipulated to find all sorts of information, and transformed into easily digestible plots to help everyone understand what the data is saying.  

##Installation Instructions
There are several py libraries that will need to be installed in order to run the code in this repo:
- SQLAlchemy
- PyYaml
- csv
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scipy
- statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Seaborn


##Usage instructions
I have removed all references to print() other than in areas necessary to extract and update the original dataframe and its subsets in order to avoid an overwhelming amount of simultaneous output and confusion. Therefore to see results of analysis and visualisations these will need to be added by the user.

##File Structure of the Project
For this project there is an overall project file, with all the code laid out in one document. Then there are individual files, one per task, to hone in on different data processing, cleaning and analytical elements

##Visualisations
In order to see an initial overview of the analysis in this project here is a collection of visualisations to look out without needing to run the code.
